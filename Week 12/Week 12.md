2-Player Pong with a twist! This game uses everyday objects hooked up to an Arduino to play the game.

## Inspiration

<br></br>
I was inspired by YouTube videos I've seen of people using these sensors to make wacky controllers to play games,
anywhere from Guitar Hero, Dark Souls, and first-person shooters:

Now that I have my own Arduino, I'd like to do something similar and make a simple game using what I've learned so far,
while using the Arduino to put in controls and put out values in interesting ways.

<br></br>
## Challenges
- Sourcing the needed hardware has already been solved. A 12 x Capacitive Touch Shield for Arduino is listed for $12.50.
<br></br>
- I'm not sure whether I want the game to be 2D or 3D. It might be rendered in 3D, and the camera can be controlled with another peripheral like a joystick or the camera is fixed at an isometric angle.
<br></br>
- A-Frame looks like an interesting webframe so I was thinking of using that for the project
<br></br>
